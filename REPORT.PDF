Project Title: AI-Powered Lead Generation Tool
Candidate: Harsh Vardhan Chauhan
Challenge: AI-Readiness Pre-Screening | Caprae Capital

Objective:
To develop a lightweight, impactful lead generation tool in under 5 hours using publicly accessible APIs and scraping methods, emulating and extending the capabilities of SaaSquatch Leads.

Approach:

Used SerpAPI to fetch official domains and extract potential emails from Google search snippets.

Added fallback scraping of each companyâ€™s /contact page to improve email retrieval rate using requests + BeautifulSoup.

Implemented a simple lead scoring algorithm based on AI-related keywords in the company name.

Tech Stack:

Python, Streamlit (for UI)

SerpAPI (for search-based leadgen)

Regex + BeautifulSoup (for contact page scraping)

dotenv (for secure API handling)

Business Value:
The tool helps sales teams enrich company data with minimal inputs (company names only) and automate discovery of official websites and emails. This makes early lead qualification faster and data-rich, which is essential for modern B2B prospecting.

Result:

Clean UI to upload CSV and download enriched leads

CSV output includes Company Name, Domain, Email, and Lead Score
